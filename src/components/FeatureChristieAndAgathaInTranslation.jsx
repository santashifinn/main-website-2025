            It’s really fun to see the differences between the covers! Let’s
            focus on <span className="italics">A Discovery Disappears</span> and
            see how that looks in each edition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is the original <span className="strong">English</span>{" "}
            edition, along with the <span className="strong">Polish</span>,{" "}
            <span className="strong">Czech</span>,{" "}
            <span className="strong">Slovak</span> and{" "}
            <span className="strong">Turkish</span> covers. I love seeing the
            lettering for the title! I think my favourite of the new versions is
            the Slovak one - it seems so bouncy and full of energy, but I really
            like them all.

              And the <span className="strong">German</span> cover. This one is
              extra fun because it’s like a remix of the original one.

              The title is smaller so you can see more of Roberta’s lovely
              background art and different illustrations of Christie and Agatha
              have been used. Agatha has a much less worried and more cheerful
              expression, while Christie and her magnifying glass look even more
              ready for action.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like that Roberta’s name is now on the signpost. I guess they
              wanted to remove the English text from the original version and
              it’s a very smart substitution!
