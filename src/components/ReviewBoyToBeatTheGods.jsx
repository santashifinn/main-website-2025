            <h3>West African rooted magical debut novel from Ashley Thorpe</h3>
            <p><span className="italics">July 2024</span></p>
            <p>
              <span className="italics">The Boy to Beat the Gods</span> is a
              vivid, pacy middle grade adventure about a young boy determined to
              put an end to the tyranny of the Orisha, the gods who are abusing
              the very humans they themselves created.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nobody but Kayode even dreams of fighting back, but when chance
              and an apparently sympathetic shapeshifting god grant him access
              to the power-giving fruit, he demonstrates that it is possible to
              challenge their tormentors.
            </p>
            <p>
              The story is a serious one that doesn’t shy away from the sad and
              scary moments, but it is lightened by the humour and heartwarming
              scenes. The balance is perfect, and the jokes always feel funny
              and appropriate, never forced.
            </p>
            <p>
              The battles were especially gripping — it’s the sign of a
              fantastic book when you nearly miss your train stop — repeatedly —
              and have to be dragged off by your family and friends while
              protesting, ‘But I need to know if they beat the hunter goddddd!’
            </p>
            <p>
              The characters are well-developed on both sides, and the shades of
              grey and mixed emotions give it significant depth.
            </p>
            <p>
              The world-building was vivid and painted a clear picture of the
              culture, especially the food, and the vocabulary makes it easy to
              research West African traditions further. I also appreciated the
              section at the end explaining about the actual Orishas, which
              inspired me to go and read more!
            </p>
            <p>
              At its core, the book is an impressively well-told and well-paced
              story about human bonds, both of family and friendship, and
              standing up against oppressors, no matter how tough and scary it
              might be. Highly recommended!
